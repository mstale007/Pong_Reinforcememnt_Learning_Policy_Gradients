# Pong_Reinforcememnt_Learning_Policy_Gradients
I have tried explaining the most simple reinforcement learning algortithm Policy Gradients to make a game bot for playing Pong Game
Try my [colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PTkhXgxgDQ7wIGj2G70jp6XJyGhqDLc9) to get started quickly.
## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install OpenAI's Gym Library.
```bash
pip install gym
```
Install pickle library 
```
pip install pickle-mixin
```
## Dependencies
* numpy
* matplotlib
* pickle

## Usage
```bash
python pong_.py
```
## Example of Learned moves
Learned weights of complete first layer to first node of second layer<br/>

## Credits
The credits for this code go to [Andrej Karpathy](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/) and his famous blog post.I've merely created a wrapper to get people started and explore this domain.

## What's Next?
I have went ahead and made a two playered Pong Game where both players are AI that are learning by playing with each other.. Do check it out [here](https://github.com/mstale007/Two_Playered_Pong_Using_Policy_Gradients)!
